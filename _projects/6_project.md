Our team developed a novel imitation learning
framework for humanoid robotics, utilizing an adversarial motion prior to enhance
motion control. By designing and training control policies with Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) and leveraging NVIDIA's Isaac Gym for large-scale simulations, I integrated my understanding of robotics from
individual modules into a cohesive, efficient, and robust policy optimization
framework.
